# Welcome to annM01's blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the San Francisco Giants and their 2019 season. I may also talk about the Golden State Warriors as they finish up the 2018 - 2019 regular season and move into the playoffs. 
Today is opening day for the Giants and they are trailing 4-0 in the 5th! :scream:
Just got a double play! :sparkles:
